# PyBank
A basic banking system using Python File System.
The program accepts staff login and then verifies the input from an already saved file(staff.txt) about staff details.
After login, it presents a list of viable options/activites that could be carried out by the staff.
The program then saves customer data and a generated 10 digits account number in the customer.txt file.
Overall the program is adequately easy to navigate and prevents unplaned termination of the program due to invalid entry.
